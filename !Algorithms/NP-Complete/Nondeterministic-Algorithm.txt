These are in essence magical algorithm's used for research. For example a NSearch algorithm is trying to be discovered that has a lookup time of O(1).
We understand the steps needed to achieve this but do not know how to fully implement it. For a nonterministic algorithm we essentially set
placeholders that we assume will work at O(1) time in the future so we can progress with our development.
Example:

Algorithm NSearch(A,n, key){

	j = choice(n); // finds index and has a lookup of O(1)
	if(key == A[j]){
	write(j);
	success(); // runtime of O(1)
	}
	write(0);
	failure(); // runtme of O(1)


}
